confessions of the shady investor

ever so often we meet new folks. and with a bit of fear and trepidation, we let these folks into our lives, and sometimes our homes, families, and within our inner circle. these friends bring their friends, and sometimes this circle enlarges. 

in the past one week, we've been awkwardly dealing with a new person who tumbled into our home, lived in our living space, ate our food, and leveraged off our social capital. what a disaster. not that i felt there was any real damage, but it just led to a lot of unneeded explaining. 

so here's my first piece of advice about meeting shady and her shady friends - 

1\. do yourself a favour. don't overbook your meetings too close together. if you do that, book them into the same place so you don't need to travel. 

2\. if you're running late, get straight to the point and don't muck around with niceties. 

3\. if you're not going to do anything with the meeting, then say so. just say, well, this is just to get to know the folks out here and build relationships. or something. just don't go there without an aim because it really pisses the people who took the time to see you off. 

4\. come to the meeting knowing what you want out of it. don't worry - it's easy for me to talk business. my life is a business. i never quite can retire. 

5\. know that you should never judge anyone. even if you don't understand what i do and how i do what i do, don't judge. i may be your very best friend, and i may also be your very worst enemy. 

6\. and after you're done, follow up. the next day. or the earliest instance. after a month, no one really gives a fuck any more.
